## 🎨 Design System

Our visual identity is rooted in earthy, calming tones inspired by nature. We use a custom Tailwind palette for semantic styling:

| Semantic Name | HEX Code | Tailwind Class |
|---------------|----------|----------------|
| Sand          | `#f5f3ef` | `bg-sand` |
| Beige         | `#d9cbb8` | `bg-beige` |
| Brown         | `#966e43` | `bg-bruin` |
| Olive Green   | `#6e6c50` | `bg-olijfgroen` |
| Dark          | `#3b3a2e` | `bg-donker` |

Accent colors like `#d9cbb8` (beige) and `#e8d5c0` (light brown) are used for buttons and headings to maintain visual harmony.
